	abstract = {At the heart of many computer network management and control tasks often lie complex optimization problems. Research over the last decades has been in pursuit for ever more accurate and faster algorithms solving such problems. More recently, we have also witnessed a significant interest in applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to tackle problems, e.g. related to routing, functions placement, or network design. In this book chapter, we review an approach that is motivated by the observation that most existing human-designed network management and control algorithms overlook a simple yet powerful optimization opportunity: many algorithms are executed repeatedly and hence with each execution, generate data: the (problem, solution)-pairs. For example, finding a path between two specific nodes describes the problem, whereas a path-finding algorithm provides the solution, namely the path. In this chapter, we provide an overview of approaches that use machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) to learn from (problem, solution)-pairs to improve actually network algorithms. We discuss the applicability for different use cases and identify challenges within those use cases as well as limitations. We review recent trends from the ML and AI research community, and how they might be applied to specific network problems. Based on this, we present future research directions geared toward data-driven algorithms design for network management and control tasks.},

  abstract = {Network programmability also sneaked into the mobile world leading to the emergence of Software-Defined Radio Access Network (SD-RAN) architectures. Interestingly, while only a small number of prototype architectures exist for SD-RAN, their performance evaluations are unfortunately also limited. Recent evaluations are carried out for small network dimensions of up to 50 devices, while emerging 5G/6G networks envision numbers of devices beyond 5000. Although 5G/6G applications are more stringent with respect to latency guarantees, performance evaluations of such low scale remain questionable. To fill this void, this paper presents MARC: a novel benchmarking tool for SD-RAN architectures and their controllers. We use MARC to measure, analyze and identify performance implications for two state-of-the-art open source SD-RAN solutions: FlexRAN and 5G-EmPOWER. We perceive results for monitoring application scenarios considering fully centralized control. For this setting, our findings show that the proposed architectures with a single SD-RAN controller are not scalable and can even lead to unpredictable network operations. Using our tool and based on our insights, we provide and implement design guidelines for the internal working behavior of the existing controllers.},

A framework for measuring network flexibility has been proposed recently, but the cost of rendering communication networks more flexible has not yet been mathematically modeled. As new technologies such as software-defined networking (SDN), network function virtualization (NFV), or network virtualization (NV) emerge to provide network flexibility, a way to estimate and compare the cost of different implementation options is needed. In this paper, we present a comprehensive model of the cost of a flexible network that takes into account its transient and stationary phases. This allows network researchers and operators to not only qualitatively argue about their new flexible network solutions, but also to analyze their cost for the first time in a quantitative way.},

In this paper, we model and analyze a realization of the mobile core network as virtualized software instances running in datacenters (DC) and SDN transport network elements (NE), with respect to time-varying traffic demands. It is our objective to determine the datacenters placement that achieves the minimum transport network load considering time-varying traffic and under a data-plane delay budget. A second objective is to achieve power savings, considering the variation of traffic over time, by using the available datacenter resources or by acquiring additional resources.},

  abstract  = {Virtualization of software defined networks enables tenants to bring their own controller and manage their virtual resources with the full programmability provided by Software Defined Networking (SDN). Distributed SDN hypervisors are proposed to provide an efficient platform for the virtualization of physical SDN networks. They address the issue of scalability that a centralized hypervisor could suffer from. As virtualization provides the possibility to change virtual SDN networks on run time, a hypervisor layer needs efficient mechanisms to dynamically adapt to the changing requirements. Existing proposals provide only a static configuration setup for their distribution of the hypervisor instances. However, in order to satisfy the dynamics of virtual SDN networks, management protocols are needed to support dynamic changes. In this paper, we propose a control path migration protocol for distributed hypervisors. Such protocol is needed to support the dynamic adaptation of the virtualization layer. Our protocol is providing the missing procedure that allows a dynamic change of control connections between virtual SDN networks and the tenants' controllers, respectively. We provide a proof of concept implementation for our proposal. Through measurements in a real testbed setup, we show that our protocol is efficient in terms of control latency overhead and provides transparency to the controllers of the virtual SDN networks.},

Combining both approaches may even be a further step towards increasing the efficiency of network resource utilization. Multiple solutions for virtualizing SDN networks have already been proposed, however, they are either implemented in software or they require special network hardware. We propose HyperFlex, an SDN hypervisor architecture that relies on the decomposition of the hypervisor into functions that are essential for virtualizing SDN networks. The hypervisor functions can be flexibly executed in software or hosted on SDN network elements. Furthermore, existing hypervisor solutions focus on data-plane virtualization mechanisms and neglect the virtualization of the control-plane of SDN networks. HyperFlex provides control-plane virtualization by adding a control-plane isolation function, either in software or on network elements. The isolation function ensures that the resources of the control-plane are shared correctly between each virtual SDN network while it also protects the hypervisor resources from resource exhaustion.

Hypervisors sit logically between the multiple virtual SDN networks (vSDNs), which reside on the underlying physical SDN network infrastructure, and the cor-responding tenant (vSDN) controllers. Different SDN network hypervisor architectures have mainly been explored through proof-of-concept implementations. We fundamentally advance SDN network hypervisor research by conducting a model-based analysis of SDN hypervisor architectures. Specifically, we intro-duce mixed integer programming formulations for four different SDN network hypervisor architectures. Our model formulations can also optimize the placement of multi-controller switches in virtualized OpenFlow-enabled SDN networks. We employ our models to quantitatively examine the optimal placement of the hypervisor instances. We compare the control plane latencies of the different SDN hypervisor architectures and quantify the cost of virtualization, i.e., the latency overhead due to virtualizing SDN networks via hypervisors. For generalization, we quantify how the hypervisor architectures behave for different network topologies. Our model formulations and the insights drawn from our evaluations inform network operators about the trade-offs of the different hypervisor architectures and help choosing an architecture according to operator demands.

  abstract  = {—Software-defined Networking (SDN) is a promising and powerful concept to introduce new dimensions of flexibility and adaptability in today's communication networks. In particu-lar, the realization of Quality of Service (QoS) concepts becomes possible in a flexible and dynamic manner with SDN. Although concepts of QoS are well researched, they were not realized in communication networks due to high implementation complexity and realization costs. Using SDN to realize QoS mechanisms enables emerging concepts, such as application-aware resource management solutions. These emerging concepts demand latency or data rate guarantees for end-user applications, e.g., video streaming or gaming. However, the impact of dynamic QoS management on network traffic has not been studied in detail yet. This paper provides a first study of the impact on dynamic QoS mechanisms and their realizations for OpenFlow-enabled SDN switches. Although SDN and, in particular, OpenFlow as one dominant realization claim to provide a standardized interface to control network traffic, our measurement results show a noticeable diversity for different OpenFlow switches. In detail, our investigations reveal a severe impact on the performance of TCP-based network traffic among different switches. These observations of switch diversity may provide SDN application developers insights when realizing QoS concepts in an SDN-based network.},

  abstract      = {Flexibility is often claimed as a competitive advantage when proposing new network designs. However, in most cases the proposals provide only qualitative arguments for their improved support of flexibility. Quantitative arguments vary a lot among different proposals. A general understanding for flexibility is not yet clearly defined, leaving it to the reader to draw the right conclusions. For networks, flexibility would refer to the ability to adapt the available network resources to changes of design requirements, e.g., lower latency budgets or different traffic distribution. Recently, new concepts such as Software Defined Networking and Network (Function) Virtualization have emerged claiming to provide more flexibility in networks. Nevertheless, a deeper understanding of what flexibility means and how it could be quantified to compare different network design choices remains open. In this paper, we raise the question whether flexibility will be a new measure for network design space analysis. We analyze how flexibility is attributed in the state of the art and show that flexibility is not well defined yet. We advocate that network research should have a deeper look into flexibility to be able to come up with quantitative arguments for network design choices with respect to flexibility. It is quite challenging to formulate a flexibility measure that covers all network aspects, however we propose an initial set of flexibility aspects to start grounding guidelines for a flexibility measure. The cost incurred to support dynamic changes, e.g., management overhead, is an important factor in the network design analysis. Our initial selection of flexibility aspects is backed up by an analysis of Software Defined Networking, Network Virtualization and Network Function Virtualization for their support of the selected flexibility aspects vs. induced cost.},

  abstract      = {Network hypervisors provide the network virtualization layer for Software Defined Networking (SDN). They enable virtual network (VN) tenants to bring their SDN controllers to program their logical networks individually according to their demands. In order to make use of the high flexibility of virtual SDN networks and to provide high performance, the deployment of the virtualization layer needs to adapt to changing VN demands. This paper initializes the study of the optimization of dynamic SDN network virtualization layers. Based on the definition of reconfiguration events, we formalized mixed integer programs to analyze the multi-objective problem of adapting virtualization layers. Our initial simulation results demonstrate Pareto frontiers of conflicting objectives, namely control plane latency and hypervisor and control path reconfigurations.},

  abstract      = {Ideally, by enabling multi-tenancy, network virtualization allows to improve resource utilization, while providing performance isolation: although the underlying resources are shared, the virtual network appears as a dedicated network to the tenant. However, providing such an illusion is challenging in practice, and over the last years, many expedient approaches have been proposed to provide performance isolation in virtual networks, by enforcing bandwidth reservations. We in this paper study another source for overheads and unpredictable performance in virtual networks: the hypervisor. The hypervisor is a critical component in multi-tenant environments, but its overhead and influence on performance are hardly understood today. In particular, we focus on OpenFlow-based virtualized Software Defined Networks (vSDNs). Network virtualization is considered a killer application for SDNs: a vSDN allows each tenant to flexibly manage its network from a logically centralized perspective, via a simple API. For the purpose of our study, we developed a new benchmarking tool for OpenFlow control and data planes, enabling high and consistent OpenFlow message rates. Using our tool, we identify and measure controllable and uncontrollable effects on performance and overhead, including the hypervisor technology, the number of tenants as well as the tenant type, as well as the type of OpenFlow messages.},

  abstract   = {Communication networks are the key enabling technology for our digital society. In order to sustain their critical services in the future, communication networks need to flexibly accommodate new requirements and changing contexts due to emerging diverse applications. In contrast to traditional networking technologies, software-oriented networking concepts, such as software-defined networking (SDN) and network function virtualization (NFV), provide ample opportunities for highly flexible network operations, enabling fast and simple adaptation of network resources and flows. This paper identifies the opportunities and challenges of adaptable softwarized networks and introduces a conceptual framework for adaptations in softwarized networks. We first explain how softwarized networks contribute to network adaptability through the functional primitives observation, composition, and control. We review the wide range of options for fine-granular observations as well as fine-granular composition and control provided by SDN and NFV. The multitude of fine-granular “tuning knobs” in adaptable softwarized networks complicates the decision making, which is the main focus of this paper. We propose to enhance the functional primitives observation, composition, and control with data-driven decision making, e.g., machine learning modules, resulting in deep observation, composition, and control. The data-driven decision making modules can learn and react to changes in the environment, e.g., new flow demands, so as to support meaningful decision making for adaptation in softwarized networks. Finally, we make the case for employing the concept of empowerment to realize truly “self-driving” networks.},

NOracle can be used with existing monitoring systems to analyze and visualize networks in an online manner or be used to analyze stored traces. Network operators can use SBMs to monitor and verify network operation, detect possible security issues and change-points. To showcase this, NOracle combines the production-grade network management solution StableNet with an SBM based anomaly detection and network visualization module. StableNet provides network flow statistics in real-time from actual devices. The SBM extracts roles and communication patterns live from the real-time data. The result can help to reason about communication behaviors, detect anomalous hosts and indicate changes in the large scale-structure of network communication.},
