I studied computer science at the University of Würzburg, Germany, where I received my diploma degree in 2012. 
After this I joined the Chair of Communication Networks at the Technische Universität München in June 2012. 
In Mai 2018, I received the degree Doktor-Ingenieur (Dr.-Ing.) from the Technische Universität München with distinction (summa cum laude, Link). 
I am currently working as a postdoctoral-researcher and associate lecturer at the Chair of Communication Networks. 
Since January 2019, I am also proud to be a Senior Research Fellow at the Communication Technologies Group, Faculty of Computer Science, University of Vienna, lead by of Prof. Stefan Schmid.
My research is focused on flexible and predictable network virtualization, virtualizing software-defined networks, as well as data-driven networking, including architecture, system, and algorithm design.

In the following, I would like to give more details on my current research topics.

Data-driven Networking & Machine Learning-based Network Design:
------

Whereas combining Network Virtualization & Software-Defined Networking is a step towards flexible and predictable network management, 
it introduces new challenges with respect to networking algorithms. 
Both concepts open new paths towards faster adaptations of communication networks. 
However, this might result in more frequent executions of networking algorithms to benefit the most from the possibilities that NV & SDN provide to manage networks. 
As most problems of managing networking resources are computational hard (flow routing, facility location, or the embedding of whole networks), 
there is a need for mechanisms that make it possible to improve algorithm efficiencies and solution qualities. 
In my research, i want to focus on the application of machine learning to improve networking algorithms further: 
e.g., networking algorithms produce valuable data of time which can be used to enhance their future executions, such as speeding up algorithms' runtimes.
