I studied computer science at the University of Würzburg, Germany, where I received my diploma degree in 2012. 
After this I joined the Chair of Communication Networks, lead by Prof. Wolfgang Kellerer, at the Technische Universität München in June 2012. 
In Mai 2018, I received the degree Doktor-Ingenieur (Dr.-Ing.) from the Technische Universität München with distinction (summa cum laude, [Link](https://d-nb.info/1160034877/34)).
I am currently working as a postdoctoral-researcher and associate lecturer at the Chair of Communication Networks. 
Since January 2019, I am also proud to be a Senior Research Fellow at the Communication Technologies Group, Faculty of Computer Science, University of Vienna, lead by Prof. Stefan Schmid.
My research is focused on flexible and predictable network virtualization, virtualizing software-defined networks, as well as data-driven networking, including architecture, system, and algorithm design.
