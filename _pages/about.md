I studied computer science at the University of Würzburg, Germany, where I received my diploma degree in 2012. After this I joined the Chair of Communication Networks, lead by Prof. Wolfgang Kellerer, at the Technische Universität München in June 2012. In Mai 2018, I received the degree Doktor-Ingenieur (Dr.-Ing.) from the Technische Universität München with highest distinction (summa cum laude, [Link](https://d-nb.info/1160034877/34)). I was a postdoctoral-researcher and associate lecturer at the Chair of Communication Networks. 
From March 2019 to January 2022, I was a Senior Research Fellow at the Communication Technologies Group, Faculty of Computer Science, University of Vienna.
Currently, I am working as a Research Scientist at Siemens AG in the T CED INW-DE group located in Munich.
My research is focused on architectures and blueprints for industrial networks with focus on verticals from factories, smart infrastructures, and smar mobility. I am researching actively the areas of digital twins, machine learning, and monitoring & observability for networking.
